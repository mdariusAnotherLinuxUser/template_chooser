# template_chooser
a tool that I use everyday, it copies templates from your ~/Templates folder to your current folder, if a file with the same name exists it will not do anything
<p>executing the program will give you a list of the current templates, each item will have an id in the left, choosing your desired template is as easy by passing the id to the the program</p>
